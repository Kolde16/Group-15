# Reflection (A5)

## General learning experience

## Process of developing the tutorial

## Summary of feedback
Make it more clear that we use the ARCH file, and that would in most cases be the relevant file.

Might wants to check if it also works with the other files, the structural file might have some useful values for the user. We Double check with other models, to see if and how it works, and if the output becomes readable.

External doors might be able to be added with more work, for example by making a boundary box and using some of the same calculation elements from the window calculation.
