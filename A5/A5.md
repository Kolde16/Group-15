# Reflection (A5)

## General learning experience
The whole idea behind OpenBIM makes much more sense the more you use it, we now know that OpenBIM is both important for intercompatibility and freedom of information. It prevents dependence on a specific product, and makes it possible to share model information with everyone. In general our leaning experience started as a BIM Analyst and we would now be at or nearing the BIM Manager level, gaining two levels of experience.

## Process of developing the tutorial
The learning process could definately prove useful in the development of a thesis, these tools could both help with automation and the general mangement when working with large models. It could be useful to be given more tools along the way, but it was nice to be able to choose our own way through.

## Summary of feedback
From the feedback we received we learned the following:
* Make it clear that the tool uses the ARCH file, and that would in most cases be the relevant file.
* Might want to check if it also works with other files, the structural file might have some useful values for the user. We Double check with other models, to see if and how it works, and if the output becomes readable.
* External doors might be able to be added with more work, for example by making a boundary box and using some of the same calculation elements from the window calculation.

The feedback makes sence, and in a situation of future development, this is the points we would work on.

## Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

### Indiviual reflection for s215308 
I would probably us OpenBIM in my thesis if i decide to make a large model of a building, or if i have to work with/ use another building model a lot.
I can see myself using OpenBIM proffessionally in sitautations were i experience incompatibility to a tool the firm is using.

## Wrap up

### Indiviual reflection for s215308 
The journey has been confusing, but i now get why and how OpenBIM can be used, and that it can be used in so many situations and building phases, which might explain why it can be so confusing going along the way.
