# BIManalyst group 15 - Focus area indoor

## Assignment A1+A2

### The claim we are checking

We are checking the U-value information of the buidlings encvelope, this includes the windows, walls, ceilings and floors. Doors and other building elements are not included in our analysis, as they are not present in the MEP report.

The assignment has been expanded from A1 only including windows, to now also include walls, ceilings and floors.

The claims are present in the 25-16-D-MEP report on page 5 and 6 in section 2,1 and 2,4, specifically in table 1 and 3. 

### Script discription

This script reads windows from an **IFC model** and exports their main properties to Excel.

#### What it does
- Gets window **dimensions** (width, height, area).
- Reads **frame width** and **rebate depth** (if available).
- Finds the **glass** and **frame materials** and their thermal conductivity.
- Calculates:
  - **Glass area** and **frame area**
  - **Glass U-value** (from conductivity)
  - **Frame U-value** (conductivity ÷ thickness, default k=0.2 if missing)
  - **Overall window U-value** as an area-weighted average

#### Output
An Excel file is created on your Desktop with one row per window, including:

- GlobalId and Name  
- Width, Height, Total Area  
- Frame width, rebate depth, and frame area  
- Glass and frame materials with conductivity  
- U-values for glass, frame, and the whole window

#### Requirements
From the IFC mocel, it is essential to get IFC classification data and geometric data. We need data from a construction library.
It would be best if the IFC included material data, but this can also be gathered from an external predefined material datasheet.
